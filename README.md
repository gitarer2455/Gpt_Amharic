# Telegram Translation and AI Response Bot

This is a **Telegram bot** that integrates **AI-based language generation** and **translation** capabilities. It receives messages in **Amharic**, translates them to **English**, sends the translated text to an AI model for generating a response, and then translates the response back to **Amharic** before sending it back to the user. Additionally, all conversations are saved to a text file for record-keeping.

## Key Features

- **Amharic to English Translation**: Translates user input from Amharic to English using Google Translate.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Sends the translated English text to the AI21 model to generate relevant responses.
- **English to Amharic Translation**: Translates the AI-generated response back to Amharic for user interaction.
- **Conversation Logging**: Saves the conversation (both user input and AI response) to a text file for record-keeping.

## How It Works

1. **Receive Message**: The bot receives an input message from the user in **Amharic**.
2. **Translate to English**: The message is translated into **English** using Google Translate.
3. **Generate Response**: The translated text is sent to the **AI21 API** (a language generation model) to produce a meaningful response.
4. **Translate Back to Amharic**: The AI response is translated back into **Amharic** and sent to the user.
5. **Log Conversation**: Both the user's message and the AI's response are saved in a file named `conversation.txt`.

## Built With ðŸ’»

- **Python Telegram API**: To interact with Telegram users and send/receive messages.
- **deep_translator**: To perform translation between Amharic and English.
- **AI21 API**: To generate AI-powered responses based on the translated text.
- **time**: To implement delays between requests to ensure smooth execution.

## Prerequisites

Before running the bot, make sure to have the following:

- **Telegram Bot Token**: Create a Telegram bot and get your API key from [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather).
- **AI21 API Key**: Sign up at [AI21](https://www.ai21.com/) and get a free API key.
- Install the necessary Python packages.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/telegram-ai-translator-bot.git
    cd telegram-ai-translator-bot
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install python-telegram-bot deep-translator ai21
    ```

3. Replace the placeholders in the code with your actual API keys:

   - `ai21.api_key = "your_ai21_api_key"`
   - `app = Application.builder().token("your_telegram_bot_token").build()`

4. Run the bot:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

The bot will now be running and responding to messages sent to it on Telegram!

## Conversation Log

All interactions (questions and AI responses) are logged in a file named `conversation.txt`. This file is saved in the same directory as the bot.

3. **AI Response**: The bot uses the AI21 model to generate a response based on the English translation.
4. **Back to Amharic**: The AI's response is translated back to **Amharic** and sent to the user.
5. **Logging**: The conversation is saved to `conversation.txt`.
